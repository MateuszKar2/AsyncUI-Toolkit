# AsyncUI-Toolkit

**AsyncUI-Toolkit** is a collection of JavaScript tools for manipulating the user interface, handling events, and working with asynchronous operations. The project consists of three main functionalities:

1. **Color Switcher** - Changes the background color of the page to a random color every second.
2. **Countdown Timer** - Counts down to a selected date.
3. **Promise Generator** - Generates promises that may resolve or reject.

## Features

### 1. Color Switcher
When the "Start" button is clicked, the background color of the page changes to a random color every second. Clicking the "Stop" button stops the color change.

### 2. Countdown Timer
A timer that counts down to a specific date. It allows users to pick a date using a calendar and then displays the remaining time in days, hours, minutes, and seconds.

### 3. Promise Generator
Generates promises that resolve or reject with varying delays. The user can specify the number of promises, and each promise resolves or rejects randomly.

## Technologies

The project uses the following technologies:
- **JavaScript (ES6+)**
- **HTML5**
- **CSS3**
- **Notiflix** - for displaying notifications about promise results.
- **Flatpickr** - for date selection in the **Countdown Timer**.
